Portable crypt modules for xs6.

See crypt.js and arith.js for APIs. It is recommended to use only those two objects, like:

    new Crypt.SHA1()

instead of

    import SHA1 from "crypt/sha1";
    new SHA1();

=== Install ===
The modules use only three standard include files:
- <stdint.h>	-- for unit32_t, etc.
- <stddef.h>	-- only for size_t
- <string.h>	-- strlen, etc.

Besides above, those modules need three C functions defined in "crypt.h":
- void *crypt_malloc(size_t sz)
- void crypt_free(void *p)
- void crypt_rng(void *buf, size_t sz)

It is a user's responsibility to implement those functions. crypt_rng
is expected to return cryptographic secure random data. (Don't even
think to use random() or rand().)

No other APIs or definisions are necessary.

=== How to make ===
makefile expects $(TMP_DIR) and $(DEST_DIR) are exported. The target
"archive" creates only .o files in $(TMP_DIR)/crypt and .xsb files
$(DEST_DIR)/crypt and $(DEST_DIR)/arith.
The "all" target creates .so files besides those .xsb files.
$(C_OPTIONS) and $(MOD_LINK_OPTIONS) have to be set appropriately depending on platforms.
$(XSC_OPTIONS) has to include -e for archive.
$(XS6_TOOL_DIR)/xsc6 is the xs compiler.
